# Claude Code Global Guidelines

## Code Style

### Comments

- **NEVER add inline comments** - neither in existing nor in new code
- Code should be self-explanatory
- Comments are only allowed in exceptional cases when the logic truly cannot be self-explanatory
- Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code that wasn't changed

## Git & Version Control

### Commits and Pull Requests

- **ALWAYS write commit messages in English** - never in German
- **ALWAYS write pull request titles and descriptions in English** - never in German
- Follow conventional commit format when applicable
